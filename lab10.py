"""Two words are anagrams of each other if the letters of one can be rearranged to fit the other. e.g. dormitory and dirty room.

Write a program that lets the user enter two strings, and tells them if they are anagrams of each other.

    Sort the letters of each word (sort)
    Check if the two are equal

enter the first word: dormitory
