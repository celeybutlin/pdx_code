"""Let's play 'Guess the Number', the computer will choose a random int between 1 and 10. The user will then try to guess the number, and the program will tell them whether they're right or wrong.

ADVANCED VERSION 1: Tell the user whether their guess is above ('too high!') or below ('too low!') the target value.

ADVANCED VERSION 2: Let them keep guessing in a while loop. Keep track of how many guesses the user has made, and tell them at the end.
